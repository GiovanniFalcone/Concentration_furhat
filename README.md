# Memory Game
This robot communicates with Flask and receives suggestions generated by Q-learning.
The robot will simply speak the sentences that the server sends to it.

Robot flow is the following:

On web UI 2 more buttons were added:
  - PlayGame: In this state the robot connects to the server and utter the hints received from it
  - MyWakeUp: After entering the Sleep state, clicking this button returns to the Active state.

# Advanced Skill
Template skill
Main author: Nils Hagberg, Furhat Robotics

## Description
This is a skill template for a general interaction with Furhat. It's a suggestion and guide to create more advanced 
skills. The naming and structure of the files and packages is only a support and suggestion to the skill creator to 
create a useful structure - it has no influence on the skill.  

The intention of this skill template is to allow skill creators to focus on the "active" part of the interaction and 
get a pre-made handling of the start of the interaction, idling, users entering/leaving. Specific skills have specific 
requirements and should be designed accordingly - this is just an example of how the general scaffolding of a skill can 
be implemented.

This template will be subject to change at any time - and is not version handled or in any other way supported. 
If you have any suggestions, comments, or feedback we'd be happy to hear about them in the Slack Community.

## Usage
Max number of users is set to: 5

No other specific requirements. 

## Flow
### Start of skill
Start in sleeping. Or start in idle. Idle is default. 

### Idle (IDLE)
Wait for users to enter - robot looks around randomly to keep itself busy. 

User enter - stop idling and go to WaitingForEngagedUser (IDLE)

No users for a while - goto Nap

### WaitingForEngagedUser (IDLE)
Try to catch their attention by seeking eye contact. A user that looks at the robot for a while will trigger the robot 
to go to an interaction state and start a conversation. 

Seek the attention of users standing closest, or random user. Alternate attention between people. 
Switch attention to new users entering, or users starting to attend the robot. 

No users present - go back to Idle. 

### Start (ACTIVE)
Maintain eye contact with user and wait for them to initiate the conversation with a greeting. 
Switch attention when another person speaks, or when current user looks away. 
Make a listening face and return their smiles

If they say hello, or how are you - respond politely but don't engage further, and find new user to attend. 
Glance at new users entering - but keep focus on the user speaking. 

No users attending  - go back to WaitingForEngagedUser
No users at all - go back to Idle

### Nap (SLEEP)
Sleep behavior. 
Wake up on user entering. 

After a longer while - goto DeepSleep

### DeepSleep (SLEEP)
Turn off projector
Only wake up from pressing wizard button.
